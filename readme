This project is made as a part of Vultr Cloud Innovate Hackathon by Team Nova from KKW Institute of Engineering, Nashik.

This project aims to develop an automated system that classifies incoming emails, identifies spam, and prioritizes emails for better management. Using machine learning algorithms, this project leverages text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification techniques to achieve accurate and efficient email categorization.

Project Overview

Department: Computer Engineering

Objectives
Develop a model to classify emails, separating spam from legitimate messages.
Prioritize emails based on content, topic classification, and sentiment analysis.
Improve user productivity by automating email categorization and spam filtering.
